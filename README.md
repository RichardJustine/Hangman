# Hangman
Hangman is a word guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player(s) tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. The word is represented by a series of dashes or underscores, with each dash representing a letter in the word.

For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure (typically a head, body, arms, and legs) is drawn on a hangman scaffold. If the player guesses the word before the entire stick figure is drawn, they win; otherwise, they lose. The game is often used as a way to improve spelling and vocabulary skills.
